# basilisk-docker

This package creates a Docker implementation of basilisk. Provides a Dockerfile to build the container, a script 'dbasiisk' to run it, and a script 'bviewhost-docker' to run Basilisk View.

Users should not usually download the Dockerfile and build it. Instead the image will be pulled from Dockerhub when running dbasilisk.
